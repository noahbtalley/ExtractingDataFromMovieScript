This program is designed to take a screenshot of a script and extract all information from it,
including scene, location, and character's actions/dialogue. Chat-GPT will output the information as a JSON and save it to the current directory.
Script extraction was chosen to keep with the theme..

Note: image file must be rasterized--no vector images--.jpg, .png, .bmp, .tiff, and .gif are all acceptable formats.
